This is an interactable Bookstore database manager based on tkinter. This code was based on a project for the Department of Anthropology, Digital Archaeology Lab at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. My former supervisor has permitted me to use this code on my work portfolio as long as changes and addditions made to it, which both have been made.


This application is very basic. It can handle insertion, editing, and deleting of rows. It is not perfect because if you select a row to edit but have a different table selected from the drop down menu, it will bring up parameters for entries for that table instead of the one currently shown. I will fix this when I have more time.

Not knowing much about tkinter I used a mixture of tkinter offical documentation, examples from the internet and Chatgpt to make the ui. I first used chatgpt to clean up my code from when it could only handle insertions and also used it when I tried new features with the UI but could not get it to work. It is like asking a tutor for help with my code. I also asked it to explain why it chose the lines it did, so I am able to explain the code myself as well if anyone needs me to.

To use the code, you just need the ui.py file and the .db file next to it, and run "python3 ui.py". I have only tested this app with the lastest version of python3, so I will say that it only works with that, to be safe.
